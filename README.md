## My process

1. Built HTML Structure using BEM
2. Structure Layout with top level CSS rules.
3. Use Pixel Perfect to make design as close to requirements.
4. Start with figuring out eventlisteners, connect eventlisteners to display.
5. Use architecture to design JS else soon it will become mess.


### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup and BEM convention
- Using Sass for CSS
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- JS Modules and Rollup JS ES build system

### What I learned 

1. SCSS is better than Sass interms of syntax and comptaible with CSS.
2. Block-Element-Modifier is difficult to maintain when tree goes too deep.
3. Javascript add and remove classses has its own difficulties
